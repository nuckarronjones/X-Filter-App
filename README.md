# 🚫 X-Filter Chrome Extension

An AI-powered Chrome extension built as a hackathon project. Utilizes AI to filter out political content, and keywords for advertisement posts. 

---

## ☁︎ Background
- My team and I set out to create a Chrome extension leveraging large language models (LLMs).  
- In one day, we built a prototype, but the code needed refinement. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/dealwith/x-filter).  
- I started fresh and extracted the best parts to create this polished, working version.
